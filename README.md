# Project: Schedule-Generator

##Problem Statement:
######Creating a schedule without any conflict is a tedious job and could take up a lot of time if done manually. At the start of every semester, every school has to create a schedule of lectures for that particular session.

##Solution
###### Our solution is to use the genetic algorithm to ease this task of schedule creation. Schedule-Generator takes in data in the form of:

1. Departments
2. Professor 
3. Course
4. Lecture Time
5. Class Room
